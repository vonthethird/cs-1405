# cs-1405
C++ repo for the Programming Fundamentals classes \
[CS-1400](https://www.snow.edu/academics/science_math/engineering/cs/course.html?crse_numb=1400&subj_code=CS) is the lecture class, [CS-1405](https://www.snow.edu/academics/science_math/engineering/cs/course.html?crse_numb=1405&subj_code=CS) is the lab class.

## Intro

### Common Questions
- **Why is the [CS-1400 folder](https://github.com/vonthethird/cs-1405/tree/master/cs-1400) _inside_ of the [CS-1405 folder](https://github.com/vonthethird/cs-1405)?** \
In **1400**, we mostly have **discussions and lectures** about coding and C++, while in **1405** we actually **write programs** in C++ and submit those files for the majority of the credit in that class. So this repo is _mostly_ dedicated to 1405, but I also keep files for 1400 notes (and occasional programs) in the repo. Sue me. :cold_sweat: \
- **Why am I using C++?** \
While C++ is pretty much outdated and almost a _dead language_ at this point in time, it's the language they teach for the earlier programming classes at Snow College, so that's why I'm using it. _#sorrynotsorry_ :information_desk_person:

### My Experience
At the time of creating this repo, this is my programming experience:
- 2 years of being a QA Engineer at [@trapezelabs](https://github.com/trapezelabs) in Provo, UT _(I left this company to pursue a college education)_
- I can write basic Python programs and read/understand some JavaScript
- I've pretty much mastered writing/reading JSON files and applying them to JS programs
- I have a good understanding of how to use Unix shells and even write bash files
- Started up the very basic foundations of a [Selenium WebDriver](https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) automated testing application in Python, but abandoned it due to other priorities at Trapeze Labs
- Now I'm in the Programming Fundamentals class at [Snow College](https://www.snow.edu/news/snow-college-ranked-number-one-in-the-nation.html) to have a formal education about how to be a programmer and learn C++ to discipline my programming skills by learning the raw foundations of how code works.

I created this repo for a _few_ reasons:
1. Keep track of my CS-1405 lab files, CS-1400 notes, and anything else involved with this class.
2. Help my fellow classmates, because many of them don't know much about coding yet. I'm happy to teach them, as well as provide them with a resource to compare their code with. Not a cheat sheet, just a reference to boost learning progress and catch up on missed assignments/notes in the case of absence(s), which is very understandable. I gotchu. ;)
3. I can use this repo to show my professor that I'm putting effort into these classes, and some of my extra work may earn me extra credit. Who knows :man_shrugging:
4. This is fairly obvious, but I want to leave some footprints somewhere of my journey in learning how to be a programmer for many reasons; i.e. for my own personal sentiment, historical documentation of my progress, something for future employers to look at as part of my resume, etc.

## Useful Info

#### If you're a random bystander, former colleague, or potential employer:
Welcome. You may think that the code in this repo is on a very novice level, which is _correct_. You may have even seen me do more advanced stuff than this before, so why am I reverting to the very basic fundamentals of programming? Mostly just because I didn't know anything about C++ when I first came to Snow College, so I feel like it's best for me to start at the very bottom and learn everything correctly in a methodical process, rather than skipping ahead to the next CS class without a good understanding of how C++ works, since that's what they teach here for at least the first few [CS classes](https://www.snow.edu/academics/science_math/engineering/cs/courses.html). So you'll cringe at some of this gross code, I can promise that. But you'll also see some progress in my coding skills, which is the most important part of this repo.

#### If you're one of my fellow CS-1400/1405 classmates:
Odds are, you don't know how to set up GitHub, which is totally understandable due to the nature of this beginner-level class. \
Use [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) to get started on GitHub.
Then, after you've made an account, use [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to connect GitHub to your computer, so you can easily access my repo and update it whenever I push updates. \
**If you're having trouble with _any_ of this**, message me on Canvas or [yeet an email](mailto:vontreid2000@gmail.com) over to me and I will gladly help you set _all_ of this up. I've already done this for a few people in the class, so it's no big deal. \

After you've connected GitHub to your computer with the SSH key, clone _(download)_ my repo with these steps:
1. Create a folder called `git` somewhere, you probably want it in either your top-level directory or in your Desktop folder (I actually keep mine in my Dropbox folder so I always have a backup because I'm a paranoid boi).https://www.snow.edu/
If you have a Mac, I'm so sorry. This will most likely be a pain in the ass for you to do, because Apple hates nice things. :apple::hocho::peach::scream:
2. Open a terminal _(Command Prompt on Windows)_ and navigate to your `git` folder with `cd`. \
Then, once your command line directory has `/git` at the end of it, paste in this: \
`git clone git@github.com:vonthethird/cs-1405` then hit the Enter key.
3. My `cs-1405` folder should now be inside of your `git` folder. \
And of course, if you weren't able to _successfully_ do this, go ahead and **hit me up**.
