    1. Indenting the statements will visually set the body of the loop apart from the surrounding code

    2. Pretest loops test the expression before each iteration of the loop body, posttest loops test it after each iteration.

    3. Because it is executed only under the condition that the expression is true.

    4. You use do-while() to execute a block of code and only loop it if it returns true under a certain condition,
    which differs from while() because it only executes the block of code if the set condition returns true before the block of code even gets compiled.

    5. while()

    6. do-while()

    7. for()
    
    8. Because variables defined inside a function have no guaranteed starting value
