/*

1. A bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid output.
   It could be an error, mistake, defect or fault, which may cause failure or deviation from expected results.

2.
    a. Syntax error: an error that indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled.
    b. Logical error: this error occurs when the desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given.
       These are fairly easy to detect if you follow the line of execution and determine why the program takes that path of execution.
    c. Run-time error: an error which occurs during program execution after successful compilation.
